# network_traffic_analyzer

This is a simple Python script using the Scapy library to monitor network traffic, identify potential security threats, and provide real-time alerts. 
This script will capture packets from the network interface, analyze them, and raise alerts based on predefined criteria such as suspicious traffic patterns or known malicious signatures.

This script uses the Scapy library, a powerful packet manipulation tool for Python. It defines two main functions:

1.analyze_packet(packet): This function is responsible for analyzing each captured packet. You can implement your packet analysis logic here. For demonstration purposes, it simply prints information about detected packets and raises an alert if an ICMP packet is detected.

2.monitor_traffic(interface): This function starts capturing packets on the specified network interface (default is "eth0"). It uses Scapy's sniff function to capture packets and calls the analyze_packet function for each captured packet.

To use this script:

Step 1: Install Scapy if you haven't already (pip install scapy).
Step 2: Save the script to a Python file (e.g., network_monitor.py).
Step 3: Run the script with appropriate permissions (sudo python3 network_monitor.py).

Make sure to run this script with appropriate permissions to capture network traffic. Additionally, you can enhance the analyze_packet function with more sophisticated threat detection logic based on your specific requirements and the types of threats you want to detect.

Note: Remember to use this script responsibly and ethically, ensuring compliance with legal and ethical considerations when scanning systems and applications for vulnerabilities.
